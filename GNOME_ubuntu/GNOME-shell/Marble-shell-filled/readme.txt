Extract me to ~/.themes
or to ~/.local/share/themes

This repository contains the Marble Shell GTK theme for GNOME on Ubuntu.

To install the theme, move the extracted folder to either of these locations:

- `~/.themes` (for a single user)
- `~/.local/share/themes` (alternative location for a single user)

After moving the files, select the theme using your GNOME Tweaks tool or your preferred appearance manager.
